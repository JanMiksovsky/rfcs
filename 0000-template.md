# Summary

Concise (roughly one paragraph) explanation of the feature.
Include a representative code snippet if it's short and self-explanatory.

# Motivation and goals

What forces are driving us to do this?
What are our goals — and non-goals — for this?
What are the desired outcomes?

# Use cases

What use cases does it support?

# Detailed design

This is the bulk of the RFC. Explain the design in enough detail for somebody
familiar with the framework to understand, and for somebody familiar with the
implementation to implement. This should get into specifics and corner-cases,
and include examples of how the feature is used. Any new terminology should be
defined here.

# Drawbacks

Why should we *not* do this? There are tradeoffs to choosing any path, please
attempt to identify them here. Consider the impact on the integration of this
feature with other existing and planned features, on the impact of the API churn
on existing apps, etc.

# Alternatives

What other designs have been considered? What is the impact of not doing this?

# Unresolved questions

Optional, but suggested for first drafts. What parts of the design are still
TBD?
